three time every u airline combined airline compete google stand alone economist use two simplified model explain difference perfect competition monopoly perfect competition considered ideal default state economics socalled perfectly competitive market achieve equilibrium producer supply meet consumer demand every firm competitive market undifferentiated sell homogeneous product since firm market power must sell whatever price market determines money made new firm enter market increase supply drive price thereby eliminate profit attracted first place many firm enter market theyll suffer loss fold price rise back sustainable level perfect competition long run company make economic profit opposite perfect competition monopoly whereas competitive firm must sell market price monopoly owns market set price since competition produce quantity price combination maximizes profit economist every monopoly look whether deviously eliminates rival secures license state innovates way top book
